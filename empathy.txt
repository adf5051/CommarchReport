latest commit was 2 weeks ago, the first seems to be 2007-04-25 (https://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/commit/?id=40c0d1ba5434b5c5d4f8b7ff6fedd1add5c03ce6)

There is a unreviewed patches page (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=patchreport.html&product=empathy&patch-status=none) but I am not sure who is accepting them. I would think it is the 2 maintainers listed XavierClaessens and GuillaumeDesmottes

The project does not seem to have a lead developer

There seems to be a lot of turnover in the project. A lot of the same people are contributing but at a much lower rate. For example, in the last few months even the maintainers haven’t made a contribution.

Total contribution is declining from 601 in 2013 to 76 in 2016 as shown by the commit counts at https://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/stats/?period=y&ofs=10

There seems to be no official documentation for the source code, online or in the source aside from comments and such.
